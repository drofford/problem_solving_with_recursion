===================

This is my solution for the Knight's Tour.

Well, that's not exactly true. It is the author's solution which I downloaded
in exchange for giving up the certificate.

Why? Well, I could not get my version to work when I incorporated Warnsdorff's
heuristic. I figured I must be doing it wrong. After way too much time and too
many rewrites I decided to bite the bullet, foresake the certificate, and see
the author's solution.

Imagine my surprise when I found it is just the brute force solution I had
worked before trying to hack in the logic for Warnsdorff's heuristic.

So do I feel a bit cheated? Yes. But it was my choice.

Anyhoo, one thing of interest is the difference in speed between the debug and
the release versions.

The debug version took 64.625511887s to run to completion. The release version
took just 5.047383292s. Wow!!!
